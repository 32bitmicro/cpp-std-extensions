== `functional.hpp`

https://github.com/intel/cpp-std-extensions/blob/main/include/stdx/functional.hpp[`functional.hpp`]
contains
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/bind_front[bind_front] and
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/bind_front[bind_back].

NOTE: https://wg21.link/P2714[P2714] added the ability (in C\\++26) to use a
non-type template parameter for the bound function; this works for function
pointers in C++17, and also for lambda expressions in C++20 and beyond.

=== `with_result_of`

`with_result_of` is a class that can be used for lazy evaluation.
`with_result_of` wraps a callable (often a lambda expression) and can
implicitly convert to the return type of the callable. It may be passed to
functions that perfectly forward their arguments - a good example is an
`emplace` function on a container - and the conversion happens only when the
required value is actually used.

[source,cpp]
----
// S is a type that is some work to construct
// so we use a maker function
struct S { ... };
auto make_S() -> S;

std::unordered_map<int, S> m;

v.emplace(0, make_S()); // this works, but incurs a temporary construct, move and destruct
v.emplace(0, stdx::with_result_of{make_S}); // this constructs S in-place thanks to RVO
----

`with_result_of` can help to achieve in-place construction, effectively by deferring
evaluation of function arguments.
