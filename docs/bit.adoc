== `bit.hpp`

https://github.com/intel/cpp-std-extensions/blob/main/include/stdx/bit.hpp[`bit.hpp`]
provides an implementation that mirrors
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/bit[`<bit>`], but is
`constexpr` in C++17. It is mostly based on intrinsics.

`to_le` and `to_be` are variations on `byteswap` that convert unsigned integral
types to little- or big-endian respectively. On a little-endian machine, `to_le`
does nothing, and `to_be` is the equivalent of `byteswap`. On a big endian
machine it is the other way around.

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr auto x = std::uint32_t{0x12'34'56'78};
constexpr auto y = stdx::to_be(x); // 0x78'56'34'12 (on a little-endian machine)
----

`to_le` and `to_be` are defined for unsigned integral types. Of course for
`std::uint8_t` they do nothing.
