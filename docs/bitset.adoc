== `bitset.hpp`

https://github.com/intel/cpp-std-extensions/blob/main/include/stdx/bitset.hpp[`bitset.hpp`]
provides an implementation that mirrors
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset[`std::bitset`], but is
`constexpr` in C++17 and has the following differences:

The underlying type can be specified: `stdx::bitset<8, std::uint16_t>` defines a
bitset with 8 bits whose storage type is `std::uint16_t`. The storage type must
be an unsigned integral type. It controls the `value_type` of the underlying
storage and hence may affect efficiency for some operations according to
platform.

* Stream input and output operators are not implemented.
* A `std::hash` specialization is not implemented.
* `to_string`, `to_ulong` and `to_ullong` are not implemented; `to_uint64_t` is available.
